    "* You are now going to determine if Nataline Portman acts in good movies. Repeat the experiment in the lecture for the *RT_NataliePortman.csv* file.\n",
    "* In the lecture, we did not explore if the cost of the license to watch each movie is related to the rating. Movie studios could be using the ratings to charge more for better rated movies. Make a similar exercise to the one in the lecture and determine if the license cost is related to the rating.\n",
